#Purpose: 
*Part of the requirement for completing my Nanodegree Google scholarship program at Udacity 
		 
*To showcase my web development skillset and a brief summary about myself.

#Method: 
*Using CSS and HTML, i tried to replicate the pdf mockup that was provided

*I used the mobile first technique and ensured contents are well displayed across small and large screen devices.
*I used flex box to rearrange the images on different screen sizes. 
*I tested for different devices using the emulator in the Chrome dev tools and used the w3 validators to validate my HTML and CSS.
